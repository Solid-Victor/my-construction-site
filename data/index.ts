  ` Founded in 1999, Southern California Construction leader that provides general
            contracting services to a broad range of commercial and industrial clients
            throughout the United States, including many Fortune 500 companies. Anchored
            by loyal employees who are dedicated to providing superior service, and grounded
            in the philosophy that honesty and integrity are as important as the bottom line,
            South West Development has enjoyed an impeccable reputation for over 17 years.
  `,
  `We have never failed to complete a project and have never had a bond claim.
            Schedules and budgets are meant to be kept, and we strive every day to do so. 
            “Safety First” for all employees is embedded in our company culture from top 
            to bottom, and our EMR is among the best in the industry.
  `,
  `
  Ultimately, our success in this business is measured one project at a time.
            After the completion of each project we undertake, there must remain a satisfied
            client - one who will ask us back for the next project and recommend us to others.
            Otherwise, we have failed in our mission of providing superior construction services.
            We simply try harder, and the results speak for themselves - give us a call if we can 
            help you with your next project.
